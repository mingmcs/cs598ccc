abstract = {Cloud incidents (service interruptions or performance degradation) dramatically degrade the reliability of large-scale cloud systems, causing customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss. With years of efforts, cloud providers are able to solve most incidents automatically and rapidly. The secret of this ability is intelligent incident detection. Only when incidents are detected timely, accurately, and comprehensively, can they be diagnosed and mitigated at a satisfiable speed. To overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based detection, we carried out years of incident detection research. We developed a comprehensive AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) framework for incident detection containing a set of data-driven methods. This paper shares our recent experience of developing and deploying such an intelligent incident detection system at Microsoft. We first discuss the real-world challenges of incident detection that constitute the pain points of engineers. Then, we summarize our intelligent solutions proposed in recent years to tackle these challenges. Finally, we show the deployment of the incident detection AIOps framework and demonstrate its practical benefits conveyed to Microsoft cloud services with real cases.},

abstract = {While remarkable advances have been achieved in cloud computing infrastructure, the way incidents (unplanned interruptions or outages of a service/product) are managed needs to be as agile and dynamics as the cloud itself. In practice, incident management is conducted through analysing a huge amount of monitoring data collected at the runtime of services. Given its data-driven nature, we deem AIOps innovations as essential to empowering cloud systems to provide more reliable online services and applications by incorporating more intelligence into the entire workflow of incident management. This paper presents a project showcase of our AIOps practices towards these goals at Microsoft. First, we brief the incident management procedure and its corresponding real-world challenges. Then, we elaborate the ML & AI techniques used for mitigating such challenges and share some application results to demonstrate the intelligence and benefits conveyed to Microsoft service products.},

However, node failures in these platforms can impact the availability of their hosted services and potentially lead to large financial losses. Predicting node failures before they actually occur is crucial, as it enables DevOps engineers to minimize their impact by performing preventative actions. However, such predictions are hard due to many challenges like the enormous size of the monitoring data and the complexity of the failure symptoms. AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations), a recently introduced approach in DevOps, leverages data analytics and machine learning to improve the quality of computing platforms in a cost-effective manner. However, the successful adoption of such AIOps solutions requires much more than a top-performing machine learning model. Instead, AIOps solutions must be trustable, interpretable, maintainable, scalable, and evaluated in context. To cope with these challenges, in this article we report our process of building an AIOps solution for predicting node failures for an ultra-large-scale cloud computing platform at Alibaba. We expect our experiences to be of value to researchers and practitioners, who are interested in building and maintaining AIOps solutions for large-scale cloud computing platforms.},

Existing approaches try to improve the observability of systems by intelligently detecting anomalous situations. Such solutions surface anomalies that are statistically significant, but may not represent events that reliability engineers consider relevant. We propose ADEPTUS, a practical approach for detection of relevant health issues in an established system. ADEPTUS combines statistics and unsupervised learning to detect anomalies with supervised learning and heuristics to determine which of the detected anomalies are likely to be relevant to the Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). ADEPTUS overcomes the labor-intensive prerequisite of obtaining anomaly labels for supervised learning by automatically extracting information from historic alerts and incident tickets. We leverage ADEPTUS for observability in the network infrastructure of IBM Cloud. We perform an extensive real-world evaluation on 10 months of logs generated by tens of thousands of network devices across 11 data centers and demonstrate that ADEPTUS achieves higher alerting accuracy than the rule-based log alerting solution, curated by domain experts, used by SREs daily.},

Specially, we use the state space generated by formal model checking to guide the testing for the system implementation, and unearth bugs in the target distributed system.

RCA automation using data mining techniques in large heterogeneous systems is, however, a challenging task, because it requires correlating multimodal information across various data sources. An increasing number of services are migrating to structured logging to enable automated monitoring and debugging of complex large-scale systems. In this paper, we leverage structured logs and association rule mining (ARM) to automate RCA. We propose the LogRule algorithm, which automatically analyzes structured logs to generate a list of explanations for an event of interest. It achieves 0.921 F1-score for the diagnosis task, while computing results 37x faster compared to the state-of-the-art solution based on FP-growth, making it a time-efficient, accurate, and interpretable ARM-based RCA algorithm.

  abstract={Logging in software development plays a crucial role in bug-fixing, maintaining the code and operating the application. Logs are hints created by human software developers that aim to help human developers and operators in identifying root causes for application bugs or other misbehaviour types. They also serve as a bridge between the Devs and the Ops, allowing the exchange of information. The rise of the DevOps paradigm with the CI/CD pipelines led to a significantly higher number of deployments per month and consequently increased the logging requirements. In response, AI-enabled methods for IT operation (AIOps) are introduced to automate the testing and run-time fault tolerance to a certain extent. However, using logs tailored for human understanding to learn (automatic) AI methods poses an ill-defined problem: AI algorithms need no hints but structured, precise and indicative data. Until now, AIOps researchers adapt the AI algorithms to the properties of the existing human-centred data (e.g., log sentiment), which are not always trivial to model. By pointing out the discrepancy, we envision that there exists an alternative approach: the logging can be adapted such that the produced logs are better tailored towards the strengths of the AI-enabled methods. In response, in this vision paper, we introduce auto-logging, which devises the idea of how to automatically insert log instructions into the code that can better suit AI-enabled methods as end-log consumers.},

abstract = {As business of Alibaba expands across the world among various industries, higher standards are imposed on the service quality and reliability of big data cloud computing platforms which constitute the infrastructure of Alibaba Cloud. However, root cause analysis in these platforms is non-trivial due to the complicated system architecture. In this paper, we propose a root cause analysis framework called CloudRCA which makes use of heterogeneous multi-source data including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), logs, as well as topology, and extracts important features via state-of-the-art anomaly detection and log analysis techniques. The engineered features are then utilized in a Knowledge-informed Hierarchical Bayesian Network (KHBN) model to infer root causes with high accuracy and efficiency. Ablation study and comprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that, compared to existing frameworks, CloudRCA 1) consistently outperforms existing approaches in f1-score across different cloud systems; 2) can handle novel types of root causes thanks to the hierarchical structure of KHBN; 3) performs more robustly with respect to algorithmic configurations; and 4) scales more favorably in the data and feature sizes. Experiments also show that a cross-platform transfer learning mechanism can be adopted to further improve the accuracy by more than 10\%. CloudRCA has been integrated into the diagnosis system of Alibaba Cloud and employed in three typical cloud computing platforms including MaxCompute, Realtime Compute and Hologres. It saves Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) more than 20\% in the time spent on resolving failures in the past twelve months and improves service reliability significantly.},

# The paper introduces CloudRCA, a root cause analysis framework for Alibaba Cloud's big data cloud computing platforms, utilizing heterogeneous multi-source data, state-of-the-art anomaly detection, and log analysis techniques to extract features, which are then employed in a Knowledge-informed Hierarchical Bayesian Network (KHBN) model. CloudRCA consistently outperforms existing approaches in f1-score, handles novel root causes, demonstrates robustness, and scales favorably, leading to a more than 20% time saving for Site Reliability Engineers and improved service reliability in Alibaba Cloud's diagnosis system, with the potential for further accuracy improvement through cross-platform transfer learning.

abstract = {Logs are widely used for system behavior diagnosis by automatic log mining. Log parsing is an important data preprocessing step that converts semi-structured log messages into structured data as the feature input for log mining. Currently, many studies are devoted to proposing new log parsers. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study comprehensively investigates the effectiveness of log parsers in industrial practice. To investigate the effectiveness of the log parsers in industrial practice, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the effectiveness of six state-of-the-art log parsers on 10 microservice applications of Ant Group. Our empirical results highlight two challenges for log parsing in practice: 1) various separators. There are various separators in a log message, and the separators in different event templates or different applications are also various. Current log parsers cannot perform well because they do not consider various separators. 2) Various lengths due to nested objects. The log messages belonging to the same event template may also have various lengths due to nested objects. The log messages of 6 out of 10 microservice applications at Ant Group with various lengths due to nested objects. 4 out of 6 state-of-the-art log parsers cannot deal with various lengths due to nested objects. In this paper, we propose an improved log parser named Drain+ based on a state-of-the-art log parser Drain. Drain+ includes two innovative components to address the above two challenges: a statistical-based separators generation component, which generates separators automatically for log message splitting, and a candidate event template merging component, which merges the candidate event templates by a template similarity method. We evaluate the effectiveness of Drain+ on 10 microservice applications of Ant Group and 16 public datasets. The results show that Drain+ outperforms the six state-of-the-art log parsers on industrial applications and public datasets. Finally, we conclude the observations in the road ahead for log parsing to inspire other researchers and practitioners.},

	abstract = {The system log generated in a computer system refers to large-scale data that are collected simultaneously and used as the basic data for determining errors, intrusion and abnormal behaviors. The aim of system log anomaly detection is to promptly identify anomalies while minimizing human intervention, which is a critical problem in the industry. Previous studies performed anomaly detection through algorithms after converting various forms of log data into a standardized template using a parser. Particularly, a template corresponding to a specific event should be defined in advance for all the log data using which the information within the log key may get lost. In this study, we propose LAnoBERT, a parser free system log anomaly detection method that uses the BERT model, exhibiting excellent natural language processing performance. The proposed method, LAnoBERT, learns the model through masked language modeling, which is a BERT-based pre-training method, and proceeds with unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection using the masked language modeling loss function per log key during the test process. In addition, we also propose an efficient inference process to establish a practically applicable pipeline to the actual system. Experiments on three well-known log datasets, i.e., HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird, show that not only did LAnoBERT yield a higher anomaly detection performance compared to unsupervised learning-based benchmark models, but also it resulted in a comparable performance with supervised learning-based benchmark models.},

  abstract={Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of any service-disrupting incident is one of the most critical as well as complex tasks in IT processes, especially for cloud industry leaders like Salesforce. Typically RCA investigation leverages data-sources like application error logs or service call traces. However a rich goldmine of root cause information is also hidden in the natural language documentation of the past incidents investigations by domain experts. This is generally termed as Problem Review Board (PRB) Data which constitute a core component of IT Incident Management. However, owing to the raw unstructured nature of PRBs, such root cause knowledge is not directly reusable by manual or automated pipelines for RCA of new incidents. This motivates us to leverage this widely-available data-source to build an Incident Causation Analysis (ICA) engine, using SoTA neural NLP techniques to extract targeted information and construct a structured Causal Knowledge Graph from PRB documents. ICA forms the backbone of a simple-yet-effective Retrieval based RCA for new incidents, through an Information Retrieval system to search and rank past incidents and detect likely root causes from them, given the incident symptom. In this work, we present ICA and the downstream Incident Search and Retrieval based RCA pipeline, built at Salesforce, over 2K documented cloud service incident investigations collected over a few years. We also establish the effectiveness of ICA and the downstream tasks through various quantitative benchmarks, qualitative analysis as well as domain expert's validation and real incident case studies after deployment.}

It brings more requirements for performance and reliability. The traditional human-dependent development and maintenance methods are overwhelmed, and need to transform to Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). As one of the most useful data resources in IT system, the log plays an important role in AIOps. There are many research on enhancing log quality, analyzing log structure, understanding system behavior, helping users to mine the effective information in logs. Based on the characteristics of logs and different strategies, this paper reviews and categorizes the existing works around the three key processes in the log processing framework of log enhancement, log parsing, and log analysis in academia, and establishes evaluation indicators for comparison and summary.

  abstract={The automation of IT incident management (i.e., handling of any unusual events that hamper the quality of IT services) is a main focus in Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOPS). The success and reputation of large-scale firms depend on their customer service and helpdesk system. These systems tend to handle client requests and track customer service agent interactions. In this research, we present a complete knowledge-based system that automates two core components of IT incident service management (ITSM): (1) Ticket Assignment Group(TAG) and (2) Incident Resolution (IR). Our proposed system bypasses the 4 core steps of the traditional ITSM process, including data investigation, event correlation, situation room collaboration, and probable root cause. It provides immediate solutions that can save companies key performance indicator(KPIs) resources and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). The experiment used an industrial, real-time ITSM dataset from a prominent IT organization comprising 500,000 real-time incident descriptions with encoded labels. Furthermore, our systems are then evaluated with an open-source dataset. Compared to the existing benchmark methodologies, there is a 5 % improvement in terms of Accuracy score. The study demonstrates AI automation capabilities in incident handling (TAG and IR) for large real- world IT systems.},

  abstract={Information Technology has become a critical component in various industries, leading to an increased focus on software maintenance and monitoring. With the complexities of modern software systems, traditional maintenance approaches have become insufficient. The concept of AIOps has emerged to enhance predictive maintenance using Big Data and Machine Learning capabilities. However, exploiting AIOps requires addressing several challenges related to the complexity of data and incident management. Commercial solutions exist, but they may not be suitable for certain companies due to high costs, data governance issues, and limitations in covering private software. This paper investigates the feasibility of implementing on-premise AIOps solutions by leveraging open-source tools. We introduce a comprehensive AIOps infrastructure that we have successfully deployed in our company, and we provide the rationale behind different choices that we made to build its various components. Particularly, we provide insights into our approach and criteria for selecting a data management system and we explain its integration. Our experience can be beneficial for companies seeking to internally manage their software maintenance processes with a modern AIOps approach.}

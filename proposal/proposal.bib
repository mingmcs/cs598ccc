abstract = {Cloud incidents (service interruptions or performance degradation) dramatically degrade the reliability of large-scale cloud systems, causing customer dissatisfaction and revenue loss. With years of efforts, cloud providers are able to solve most incidents automatically and rapidly. The secret of this ability is intelligent incident detection. Only when incidents are detected timely, accurately, and comprehensively, can they be diagnosed and mitigated at a satisfiable speed. To overcome the limitations of traditional rule-based detection, we carried out years of incident detection research. We developed a comprehensive AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) framework for incident detection containing a set of data-driven methods. This paper shares our recent experience of developing and deploying such an intelligent incident detection system at Microsoft. We first discuss the real-world challenges of incident detection that constitute the pain points of engineers. Then, we summarize our intelligent solutions proposed in recent years to tackle these challenges. Finally, we show the deployment of the incident detection AIOps framework and demonstrate its practical benefits conveyed to Microsoft cloud services with real cases.},

abstract = {While remarkable advances have been achieved in cloud computing infrastructure, the way incidents (unplanned interruptions or outages of a service/product) are managed needs to be as agile and dynamics as the cloud itself. In practice, incident management is conducted through analysing a huge amount of monitoring data collected at the runtime of services. Given its data-driven nature, we deem AIOps innovations as essential to empowering cloud systems to provide more reliable online services and applications by incorporating more intelligence into the entire workflow of incident management. This paper presents a project showcase of our AIOps practices towards these goals at Microsoft. First, we brief the incident management procedure and its corresponding real-world challenges. Then, we elaborate the ML & AI techniques used for mitigating such challenges and share some application results to demonstrate the intelligence and benefits conveyed to Microsoft service products.},
